# Functional Programming Demo

For this tutorial, you will be converting an imperative program into a functional program using Haskell. 

### Pre-Requisites

Haskell Setup
* Follow the Haskell installation at https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/install/. You will only need the default installation.
* Download the Haskell VSCode extension at https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=haskell.haskell.

Pre-made Files
* `main.py`: This file shows all the tasks you need to complete using functional programming
* `main.hs`: This blank file is where you'll complete all your Haskell tasks

## Haskell Tutorial

First, let's try writing a basic program. Open `main.hs`, and type in the following code:

```hs
main = print "Hello, world!"
```

Then run this using `runghc src/main.hs`. It should print "Hello, world!" to the terminal.
